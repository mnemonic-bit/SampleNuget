# Welcome to the SampleNuget project

This project is only for instructional purposes to learn how C# projects
can be deployed as Nuget. It has a single csproj, which contains nothing
more than a single class.

There are two points of interest here:
* The `SampleNuget/SampleNuget.csproj` file which contains a lot of useful tags
* The `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml` file which defines how the parts come all together with the means of a Github action.
